## Israel - Orthodox
> Prompt: In the context of history and religious studies, summarize the origins, history, and development of the subgroups of Orthodox Judaism in Israel. Provide scholarly references. <br>

Orthodox Judaism in Israel encompasses various subgroups, each with distinct historical backgrounds and practices. Here is a summary of the origins, history, and development of the main subgroups of Orthodox Judaism in Israel, along with scholarly references:  
   
1. Modern Orthodox Judaism:  
Modern Orthodox Judaism combines traditional Jewish beliefs and practices with a commitment to engaging with modern society. It originated in the 19th and early 20th centuries in response to the challenges posed by the Enlightenment and secularism. In Israel, Modern Orthodox Jews often participate in the workforce, serve in the military, and engage in secular education alongside religious studies.  
   
Reference: Ferziger, A. S. (2005). "Modern Orthodoxy in Israeli Religious Zionism: A Case of Divergent Perceptions." Modern Judaism, 25(2), 115-145.  
   
2. Haredi (Ultra-Orthodox) Judaism:  
Haredi Judaism, also known as Ultra-Orthodox Judaism, emphasizes strict adherence to Jewish law (Halakha) and the separation from secular society. Haredi Jews in Israel originated primarily from Eastern European communities that migrated during the 19th and 20th centuries. This group often avoids participation in secular education, military service, and the secular workforce, focusing instead on religious study and observance. Haredi Judaism is further divided into various Hasidic and non-Hasidic sects.

3. Hasidic Judaism:  
Hasidic Judaism, a subgroup within Haredi Judaism, originated in 18th century Eastern Europe, emphasizing spiritual revival, mysticism, and the charismatic leadership of the Rebbe (spiritual leader). Hasidic Jews in Israel maintain strong connections to their European roots and are organized into various dynasties, each with a unique history, customs, and religious practices. Some well-known Hasidic groups in Israel include Satmar, Chabad-Lubavitch, Breslov, and Belz.

4. Sephardic and Mizrahi Orthodox Judaism:  
Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews, who trace their origins to Spain, Portugal, and the Middle East, have their own Orthodox Jewish traditions and customs. In Israel, they have largely integrated into the broader Orthodox community, but some distinct practices and institutions remain. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, a prominent Sephardic rabbi, founded the Shas political party in 1984, which represents the interests of Sephardic and Mizrahi Haredi Jews in Israel.

The subgroups within Orthodox Judaism in Israel reflect diverse historical backgrounds, cultural traditions, and approaches to religious observance. Each group has shaped the religious landscape of Israel and contributed to the richness of Jewish life in the country.
